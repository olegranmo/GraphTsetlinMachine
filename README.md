## Tutorial 

In this tutorial, you create graphs for the Noisy XOR problem and then train and test the Graph Tsetlin Machine on these.

Noisy XOR gives four kinds of graphs, shown below:

</p>

Observe how each node in a graph has one of two properties: **A** or **B**. If both of the graph's nodes have the same property, the graph is given the class label _Y=0_. Otherwise, it is given the class label _Y=1_.

The task of the Graph Tsetlin Machine is to assign the correct class label to each graph when the labels used for training are noisy.

### Initialization

Start by creating the training graphs using the _Graphs_ construct:
```bash
graphs_train = Graphs(
    10000,
    symbols = ['A', 'B'],
    hypervector_size = 32,
    hypervector_bits = 2
)
```
You initialize the graphs as follows:
- *Number of Graphs.* The first number sets how many graphs you are going to create. Here, you prepare for creating _10,000_ graphs.

- *Symbols.* Next, you find the symbols **A** and **B**. You use these symbols to assign properties to the nodes of the graphs. You can define as many symbols as you like. For the Noisy XOR problem, you only need two.

- *Vector Symbolic Representation (Hypervectors).* You also decide how large hypervectors you would like to use to store the symbols. Larger hypervectors room more symbols. Since you only have two symbols, set the size to _32_. Finally, you decide how many bits to use for representing each symbol. Use _2_ bits for this tutorial. You then get _32*31/2 = 496_ unique bit pairs - plenty of space for two symbols!
  
- *Generation and Compilation.* The generation and compilation of hypervectors happen automatically during initialization, using [sparse distributed codes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/917565).

### Adding the Nodes

The next step is to set how many nodes you want in each of the _10,000_ graphs you are building. For the Noisy XOR problem, each graph has two nodes:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    graphs_train.set_number_of_graph_nodes(graph_id, 2)
```
After doing that, you prepare for adding the nodes:
```bash
graphs_train.prepare_node_configuration()
```
You add the two nodes to the graphs as follows, giving them one outgoing edge each:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
  number_of_outgoing_edges = 1

  graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 1', number_of_outgoing_edges)

  graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 2', number_of_outgoing_edges)
```

### Adding the Node Edges

You are now ready to prepare your graphs structure for adding edges:
```bash
graphs_train.prepare_edge_configuration()
```

After that, you connect the two nodes of each graph with two edges:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    edge_type = "Plain"
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 1', 'Node 2', edge_type)
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 2', 'Node 1', edge_type)
```
You need two edges because you build directed graphs, and with two edges you cover both directions. We use only one type of edges for this, which we name _Plain_.

### Adding the Node Properties and Class Labels

In the last step, you randomly assign property *A* or *B* to each node.
```bash
Y_train = np.empty(10000, dtype=np.uint32)
for graph_id in range(10000):
    x1 = random.choice(['A', 'B'])
    x2 = random.choice(['A', 'B'])

    graphs_train.add_graph_node_property(graph_id, 'Node 1', x1)
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_property(graph_id, 'Node 2', x2)
```
Based on this assignment, you set the class label of the graph. If both nodes get the same property, the class label is _0_. Otherwise, it is _1_.
```bash
    if x1 == x2:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 0
    else:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 1
```
The class label is finally randomly inverted to introduce noise.
```bash
    if np.random.rand() <= 0.01:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 1 - Y_train[graph_id]
```
